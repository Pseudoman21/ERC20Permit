## ERC20 Permit

This project is an implementation of an ERC2612 enabled ERC20 token.

It allows to use signatures calculated off-chain to increase allowances using `permit`. The call to `permit` doesn't need to be done by the `holder`, so this contract allows the implementation of "gas-less" tokens, or the replacement of `approve` transactions by methods that call `permit` and `transferFrom` atomically.

Most of the code in this repository was written by Georgios Konstantopoulos.
